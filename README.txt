WEAPONS EXTENDED 5
==================

Weapons Extended 5 Extension for Transcendence
https://github.com/digdug34/Weapons-Extended


USAGE
=====

WE5 requires Transcendence 1.08b, it won't work with any other previous version.
Simply unzip into your Extensions folder. Be sure to maintain the original subdirectories tree.
Start a game and configure your gaming experience from the ship interior menu BEFORE leaving Eridani.
After leaving Eridani the menu will be unavailable.


CONFIGURABLE OPTIONS INGAME
===========================

- Vanilla mode = weapons are randomized using a set of attributes like damagetype, sovereign, etc. For example a Corsair will always get a laser weapon.
- Periculi's mode =  weapons are freely randomized. Game can be quite unbalanced in this mode.

- EASY/NORMAL/HARD mode = Difficulty selection will change the levels of the weapons installed on ships making the game easier or harder. Hard mode shields won't kick in before Rigel Aurelius (this is to prevent the game to become to hard)

- Dark weapons SKIP SHIELDS =  as a default setting, dark weapons like the Penitent Cannon skip shields completely as in Transcendence 0.95. Settings can be changed to vanilla to have normal interaction with shields.

- All the Weapons are unidentified by default. Player can decide to make the identified for an easier game.

- The randomizer can be turned off completely, if the player just want to play with the additional weapons.
